This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug caused by loose equality (==) and shows how to resolve it using strict equality (===). Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion, resulting in incorrect comparisons. The solution uses strict equality, which prevents type coercion and ensures accurate comparisons.
